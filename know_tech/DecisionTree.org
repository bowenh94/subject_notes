* Bagging of decision trees 
** Difference with random forest 
   random forest: bagging + randomly selected attributes 
   Advantage: avoid the dominite attribute in every decision tree. 
** Main idea
   Do classification for several times to reduce the possibility of failure
* KNN 
** Main idea 
   based on geometric distance, and find the K nearest neighbours
